    <p><caption><b>Walt Disney World</b></caption></p>
    <p><mark>The Walt Disney World Resort</mark> (also known as Walt Disney World or Disney World) is an entertainment resort complex located about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Orlando, Florida, United States. Opened on October 1, 1971, the resort is operated by Disney Experiences, a division of The Walt Disney Company. The property covers nearly 25,000 acres (39 sq mi; 101 km2), of which half has been developed.[4] Walt Disney World contains numerous recreational facilities designed to attract visitors for an extended stay, including four theme parks, two water parks, four golf courses, conference centers, a competitive sports complex and a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex. Additionally, there are 19 Disney-owned resort hotels and one camping resort on the property, and many other non-Disney-operated resorts on and near the property.</p>

    <p style="color:cyan;"> <caption><U>Planning and construction</U></caption></P>
    <p><b>Conception</b></p>
    <p><strike>in1945 didney world</strike> In 1959 , Walt Disney Productions began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955. Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.[7]</p>
    <p><strong>Roy Disney's oversight of construction</strong></p>
    <p><i>Walt Disney died from circulatory collapse caused by smoking-related lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized.[15] His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.</i></p>
